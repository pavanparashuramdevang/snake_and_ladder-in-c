# snake and ladder in c
this is a text based snake and ladder game in c 

you can run this using any c compiler 

big screen is good for viewing 

In this game I've used letters to represent the board\
@ symbols to represent the cells\
\# to represent the first person\
$ to represent the second person\
& to represent if both in same cell\
^ to represent the snake\
: to represent the ladder

you can change any of it in the code to your liking
